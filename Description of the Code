The above code is a Java program for a Personal Budget Planner. It provides users with options
to add, remove, and print expenses. It uses an ArrayList to store Expense objects, where each
Expense object represents a single expense with a name and an amount.
Let's break down the code step by step:
The first two lines of the code import two classes from the Java utility package: Scanner and
ArrayList. The Scanner class provides methods to read input from the user, while the ArrayList
class provides a dynamic array to store Expense objects.
The program defines a class called PersonalBudgetPlanner, which contains the main method.
The main method starts by printing a menu and prompting the user to select an option. It then
uses a switch statement to execute the appropriate method based on the user's choice.
The printMenu method simply prints the menu options to the console.
The getChoice method prompts the user to enter a choice and returns the integer value entered.
The addExpense method prompts the user to enter an expense name and amount, creates a new
Expense object with these values, and adds it to the budget ArrayList.
The removeExpense method prompts the user to enter an expense name, loops through the
budget ArrayList to find the Expense object with that name, and removes it if found.
The printBudget method prints the current budget to the console. If the budget ArrayList is
empty, it prints a message indicating that there are no expenses. Otherwise, it loops through
the ArrayList, printing the name and amount of each expense and calculating the total. It then
prints the total at the end.
The Expense class is a simple class that has a constructor to initialize the name and amount of
an expense, and getters to retrieve the name and amount values.
Overall, this program provides a basic interface for managing a personal budget. Users can add
and remove expenses, as well as view a summary of their budget. However, it does not provide
any advanced features such as budget categories, sorting, or searching.
